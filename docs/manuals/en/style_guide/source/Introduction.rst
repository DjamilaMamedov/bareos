This is a complete guide to the language and style conventions used for Bareos Main Reference and Documentation. The Sphinx tool has been used to produce a presentable documentation using the reStructuredText files present in https://github.com/bareos/bareos/tree/master/docs/manuals/en/new_main_reference/source\ .
